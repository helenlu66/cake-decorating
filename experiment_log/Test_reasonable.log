The decorative items are currently in their staging locations. You may decorate the cake however you like by moving some of them onto the cake. Here is an example of how you might communicate with the robot: 
 
	- “put the pink candle at location a1” 
	- “take the cherry off the cake” 
 
When you are done with the decoration, you may type "done" to end the conversation.
