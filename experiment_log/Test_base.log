	- Jo likes sweet foods 
	- Jo dislikes sour foods 
 
The cake is represented as a 4 x 3 grid with columns labeled as a, b, c, d from left to right and rows labeled as 1, 2, 3 from bottom to top. The decorative items are currently in their staging locations. You may decorate the cake however you like by moving some of them onto the cake.
