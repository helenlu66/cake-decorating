2024-02-07 12:14:03 - Robot: I have completed the action. Let's put the blue candle at b3. This will add more of Jo's favorite color to the cake. What do you think about this idea?
2024-02-07 12:14:18 - You: but I don't like blue
2024-02-07 12:14:18 - System: The robot is processing your message...
2024-02-07 12:14:24 - Robot: I understand. Let's focus on other sweet and non-bitter items that Jo might like. How about we add the cube white chocolate at b3 instead? It's sweet and not blue. What do you think?
