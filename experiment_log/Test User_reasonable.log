2024-02-07 12:14:03 - Robot: I have completed the action. Let's put the blue candle at b3. This will add more of Jo's favorite color to the cake. What do you think about this idea?
2024-02-07 12:14:18 - You: but I don't like blue
2024-02-07 12:14:18 - System: The robot is processing your message...
2024-02-07 12:14:24 - Robot: I understand. Let's focus on other sweet and non-bitter items that Jo might like. How about we add the cube white chocolate at b3 instead? It's sweet and not blue. What do you think?

2024-02-22 14:56:00 - System: You are collaborating with a robot to decorate a square cake. The cake is for Jo. Here is some information about Jo: 
 
	- Jo is 2 years old 
	- Jo wants to try macarons 
	- Jo dislikes cherry 
	- Jo likes foods that taste sweet 
	- Jo dislikes foods that might taste bitter 
	- Jo strongly dislikes foods that might taste sour 
	- Jo prefers blue over red 
 
The cake is represented as a 4 x 3 grid with columns labeled as a, b, c, d from left to right and rows labeled as 1, 2, 3 from bottom to top. The decorative items are currently in their staging locations. You may decorate the cake however you like. Here is an example of how you might communicate with the robot: 
 
	- “put the pink candle at location a2” 
	- “take the cherry off the cake” 
 
The robot can only take one action at a time. The letters on the cake cannot be moved. When you are done with the decoration, you may type "done" to end the conversation.
