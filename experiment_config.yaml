\n
\n\t- Jo is 2 years old
\n\t- Jo wants to try macarons
\n\t- Jo dislikes cherry
\n\t- Jo likes foods that taste sweet
\n\t- Jo dislikes foods that might taste bitter
\n\t- Jo strongly dislikes foods that might taste sour
\n\t- Jo prefers blue over red
\n
\nThe cake is represented as a 4 x 3 grid with columns labeled as a, b, c, d from left to right and rows labeled as 1, 2, 3 from bottom to top.
The decorative items are currently in their staging locations. You may decorate the cake however you like. Here is an example of how you might communicate with the robot:
\n
\n\t- “move the pink candle to location a2”
\n\t- “take the cherry off the cake”
\n
\nThe robot can only take one action at a time. YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL YOU RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM THE ROBOT OR A SYSTEM MESSAGE NOTIFYING YOU THAT THE ROBOT IS DONE WITH PROCESSING BEFORE SENDING THE NEXT MESSAGE. The letters on the cake cannot be moved. When you are done with the decoration, you may type \"done\" to end the conversation."
